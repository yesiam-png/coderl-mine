## Overview

rLLM is an open-source project to fully democratize reinforcement learning (RL) for LLMs and reproduce DeepSeek R1 and OpenAI O1/O3 at scale on real tasks. For all releases, we open source all our efforts here-including training scripts (including hyperparameters), models, systems, dataset, and logs.

The best 32K checkpoint is used for inference-time scaling to 64K, achieving 60.6% LCB‚Äîmatching o3-mini's performance.

<strong>[2025/02/10]</strong> We release `DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview`, a 1.5B model that surpasses O1-Preview and achieves <strong>43.1% Pass@1</strong> on AIME. We achieve this by iteratively scaling Deepseek's GRPO algorithm from 8K‚Üí16K->24K context length for thinking. As part of this release, we open-source:

## Getting Started üéØ
### Installation
```bash
# Installing Python 3.10 Environment.
conda create -n rllm python=3.10 -y
conda activate rllm

# Installing RLLM dependencies.
cd rllm
pip install -e ./verl
pip install -e .
```

### Data
Our raw training data is in `rllm/data/[train|test]/[code|math]/`, along with preprocessing scripts in `rllm/data/preprocess`. To convert the raw data into Parquet files for training, run:

```bash
# Download datasets from GDrive, populates rllm/data/[train|test]/[math|code]/*.json
python scripts/data/download_datasets.py

# Generate parquet files for Deepcoder/DeepscaleR in data/*.parquet
python scripts/data/[deepcoder|deepscaler]_dataset.py
```

### Training Scripts

We provide training scripts for both DeepCoder and DeepScaleR models in the `scripts/[deepcoder|deepscaler]/train/`. To fully reproduce our DeepCoder and DeepScaleR results, please refer to the corresponding `README.md` files in each directory.

#### Single-Node Training
```bash
export MODEL_PATH="deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B"
./scripts/[deepscaler|deepcoder]/train/[file].sh --model $MODEL_PATH
```

#### Multi-Node Training

For experiments that require multiple nodes, 

1. On the head node:
```bash
# Set XFormers backend to avoid CUDA errors
export VLLM_ATTENTION_BACKEND=XFORMERS
# Start Ray head node
ray start --head
```

2. On each worker node:
```bash
# Set XFormers backend to avoid CUDA errors
export VLLM_ATTENTION_BACKEND=XFORMERS
# Connect to head node (replace with your head node's address)
ray start --address=[RAY_ADDRESS]
```

3. Finally, on the head node, run the training script:
```bash
# Run 16K or 24K context length training
./scripts/[deepscaler|deepcoder]/train/[file].sh --model [CHECKPOINT_PATH]
```
We welcome the community to try out different models, context lengths, and RL parameters in our provided training scripts!

## Evaluation ‚öñÔ∏è

Our evaluation scripts automatically runs many replicas of vLLM. To run our evaluation scripts, run:
```bash
./scripts/eval/eval_model.sh --model [CHECKPOINT_PATH] --datasets [DATASET1] [DATASET2] --output-dir [OUTPUT_DIR] --n [N_PASSES] --tp [TENSOR_PARALLEL_SIZE] --max-length [MAX_CONTEXT_LENGTH]
```

To replicate our Deepcoder/Deepscaler evaluation, see `scripts/eval/README.md`.

## System ü§ñ

<div align="center">
  <img src="figures/verl_pipeline.png" width="60%" />

  <sub>*Our verl-pipe extension (One-off Pipeline) masks away trainer and reward computation times,reducing training times by 1.4x for math and 2x for coding.*</sub>
</div>

To accelerate post-training, we develop `verl-pipe`, an asynchronous pipelined version of verl, that reduces end2end training times by up to **2x**. Such changes are implemented in`agentica-project/verl-pipeline`. See our [blog post](https://pretty-radio-b75.notion.site/DeepCoder-A-Fully-Open-Source-14B-Coder-at-O3-mini-Level-1cf81902c14680b3bee5eb349a512a51) for more details.

We've trained `DeepCoder-1.5B-Preview`, not `DeepCodeR-14B-Preview`, with `verl-pipe`, increasing LiveCodeBench scores from 17->25%.

To install `verl-pipeline`, run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/agentica-project/verl-pipeline.git
cd verl-pipeline
pip install -e .
```

Example scripts to run pipelined post-training are located in `scripts/pipeline`. We note our `verl-pipeline` is 1-2 weeks behind verl main.
